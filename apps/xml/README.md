# `scstuff/apps/xml`

This directory contains some Python scripts to dump and filter
SeisComP XML.

### `scstuff.xml-dump-with-mt.py`

Dump origin and moment tensor information to SeisComP XML.

Could be invoked like:

```
  scstuff.xml-dump-with-mt.py --debug -d "$db" -E "$evid" |
  sccnv -f -i trunk:- -o qml1.2:"$evid-mt.QuakeML"
```

The above will dump the event information to QuakeML 1.2.

The functionality of `scstuff.xml-dump-with-mt.py` is similar to
`scxmldump`. ~~The difference is that scxmldump-public-with-mt doesn't
load arrivals and picks for speed, but also loads additional origins
references by the moment tensor objects, like triggering and derived
origins. Due to not loading arrivals it is also very fast.~~

Note that `scxmldump` has been improved to also dump all MT-relevant
objects, but we keep this script here for reference and also as a demo
about how to do things in Python.


### `scstuff.xml-to-mt-txt.py`

This reads SeisComP XML as generated by scstuff.xml-dump-with-mt.py
and dumps a simple textual representation of the moment tensor
solution. To be used in email bulletins etc.

```
  scstuff.xml-dump-with-mt.py --debug -d "$db" -E "$evid" |
  scstuff.xml-to-mt-txt.py > "$evid-mt.txt"
```
