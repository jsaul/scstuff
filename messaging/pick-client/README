This is a minimalistic script to demonstrate how to connect to the
SeisComP 3 messaging and to receive and process messages. It handles
the very simple (nearly trivial) case of picks and amplitudes and
the only thing is does is dump a few informations about the objects
to stdout. If you want to do something else with the objects (likely
you do...), then adopt the doSomethingWith*() methods accordingly.
