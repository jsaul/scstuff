Demo script that sends double-couple focal mechanisms to a SeisComP
messaging. The focal mechanism will then be displayed in the GUIs
like scesv.

While functioning, this is really only a demo. In a production
version, the script would possibly send complete moment tensors and
populate a lot more fields. But as it is the script can be used as
starting point for own developments - that's the intention.
