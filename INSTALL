It is a good idea to install scstuff along with your SeisComP
Python codes. The simplest way to do that is by copying the scstuff
subfolder to the same folder as the SeisComP Python codes.

If your Python installation is under $HOME/seiscomp, this would mean

cp -pr scstuff $HOME/seiscomp/lib/python

You can also use the setup.py script, of course:

~/seiscomp/bin/seiscomp-python setup.py install --home=$HOME/seiscomp
